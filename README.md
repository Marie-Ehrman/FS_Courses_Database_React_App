# Techdegree-Project-10
 Full Stack App with REST API

 ### Course Database Manager
 This Project reads in data from a SQL database.
 
 Users can click on the Course "Cards" to go to the Course page. Clicking on a Course "Card" will route the user to the Course Detail page.
 
 A user may create an account if they do not have one, or sign into their account if they do.

 If the user owns the course, they can Update the Course Data and save the changes. The Course can also be deleted from this page.

 Users can also enter a new Course to the database.
